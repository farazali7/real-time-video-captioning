# Setup
1) Go to the directory that contains the requirements.txt file at the same level and then run:
*pip install -r requirements.txt*

2) You would also need to install azcopy as a shell command to run (you could install either using a cmd command or install executable and then add its directory to environment variables or syspath).
If you are running on OSX then do the following if you have homebrew:
*brew install azcopy*
