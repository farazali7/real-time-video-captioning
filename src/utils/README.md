## Data Loader

`dataloader.py` defines a PyTorch `Dataset` class for loading video frames and corresponding captions, applying transformations, and encoding captions using a tokenizer. It also includes a custom collate function to handle batches of variable-sized caption tensors.


## Frame Sampling Methods

`frame_sampling_methods.py` provides several functions for sampling frames from a video. This includes uniform sampling, random sampling from bins, clustered sampling using K-means, frame difference sampling based on MSE, and scene change detection sampling using histogram comparison.


## Masking Utilities

`masking.py` includes simple yet essential functions for creating padding masks and causal masks, which are commonly used in transformer models to handle variable-length sequences and prevent information leakage.


## Tokenizer

`tokenizer.py` contains a function to encode text captions into sequences of integers using a pretrained tokenizer. It's designed to prepare text data for processing by machine learning models.


## Video Handlers

`video_handlers.py` features a collection of functions to interact with video data directly. This includes extracting frames, downsampling, resizing, converting to grayscale, and applying various feature enhancement techniques like histogram equalization and unsharp masking.

Each utility script in the `utils` directory plays a vital role in the preprocessing pipeline for video captioning tasks, from reading video data and extracting frames to preparing textual data for the model. Together, these scripts facilitate the complex data handling required for processing video and text data in machine learning workflows.
