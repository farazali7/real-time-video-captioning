# PyTorch Lightning Logs

## Overview
This directory is designated for storing logs generated by the PyTorch Lightning Trainer during the training process. PyTorch Lightning is a lightweight PyTorch wrapper that helps organize your deep learning code, making it more readable and reusable. It is built on top of PyTorch and abstracts much of the boilerplate code needed for training, making the process more straightforward and less error-prone.
